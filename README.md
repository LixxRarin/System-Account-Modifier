# System-Account-Modifier

## What is it?

"System-Account-Modifier" is a simple Python script for tweaking who shows up on your Linux login screen.

## How to Use

0. Clearly, you should be using a Linux system; in my case, I use Zorin OS.
2. Make sure you run the script (start.py) with superuser privileges.
3. Run the script, and it'll show you a list of users and whether they're visible or hidden.
4. Choose a user to change their visibility status.
5. The script will update the config file.
6. If your user is still visible/hidden in the settings, you may need to log out of your current session (or restart), and you're good to go.
